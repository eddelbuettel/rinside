Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications
 The RInside packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++ application
 by providing a C++ wrapper class providing the R interpreter.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build of R
 is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use
 the same tools used to build R itself.  
 .
 Numerous examples are provided in the six subdirectories of the examples/
 directory of the installed package: standard, mpi (for parallel computing)
 qt (showing how to embed RInside inside a Qt GUI application), wt (showing
 how to build a 'web-application' using the Wt toolkit), armadillo (for
 RInside use with RcppArmadillo) and eigen (for RInside use with RcppEigen).
 .
 Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the
 RInside website as well.
