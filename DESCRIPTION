Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications
 The RInside packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++ application
 by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build of R
 is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use
 the same tools used to build R itself.  (NB: Windows versions curretly
 seg.fault and debugging help would be appreciated. An older version worked
 fine, but there may have been some Rcpp changes which caused this.)
 .

 Numerous examples are provided in the three subdirectories the examples/
 directory of the installed package: standard, mpi (for parallel computing)
 and qt (showing how to embed RInside inside a Qt application).
 .
 Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the
 RInside website as well.
