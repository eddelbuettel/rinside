Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications
 The RInside packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your
 C++ application by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded, a shared library build of R is required.
 This works on Linux and OS X, but not necessarily on Windows due
 to the way R is built on Windows.
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0), Rcpp
